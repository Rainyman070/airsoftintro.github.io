      <p>Airsoft (AKA. survival game) is a team game in which participants(Airsofters) eliminate opposing players by tagging them out of play with spherical plastic projectiles shot with mock air weapons called airsoft guns.
Various game modes in shooter videogames like  flag, hostage, bomb can also be played in reality with Airsoft.

Across Japan, South East Asia, North America and Europe there are hundreds of thousands of Airsofters who put on their combat gear, heave on their webbing and grab their rifles each weekend.

      <p>Airsoft originated in Japan in the early 1980′s as the Japanese answer to the American craze of Paintball. 
In my research, Japanese has stricter laws restricted them from owning a real gun or even paintball gun, that's one of the reason they developed Airsoft, to have better performance using low kinetic energy that didn't surpass the legal limit.

Over the years, Airsoft has advanced in both technologies and as a sport, granting higher performance and more realistic cycling guns,allowed for greater realism and gameplay experience. 

Taiwan is also a major player in the Airsoft market, with less law restriction and more flexibility, Many past toy manufacturers adapted the Japanese airsoft system and improved upon their performance, using more realistic materials, and developed unique features, becoming one of our big exporting products, I think this is a great example of Industrial transformation.(sort of?) </div>
